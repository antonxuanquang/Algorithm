	 * Sorted Search, No Size: you are given an array-like data structure Listy
	 * which lacks a size method. It does, however, have an elementAt(i) method 
	 * that returns the element at index i in O(1) time. If i is beyond the bounds 
	 * of the data structures, it returns -1. (For this reason, the data structure
	 * only supports possitive integers). Given a Listy which contains sorted, positive
	 * integers, find the index at which an element x occurs. If x occurs multiple times,
	 * you may return any index.
