	 * Peaks and Valleys: In an array of integers, a "peak" is an element
	 * which is greater than or equal to the adjacent integers and a "valley"
	 * is an element which is less than or equal to the adjacent integers. 
	 * For example, in the array {5, 8, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6}, {8, 6} are peaks 
	 * and {5, 2} are valleys. Given an array of integers, sort the array 
	 * into an alternating sequence of peaks and valleys.
	 * 
	 * EXAMPLE:
	 *  + input: {5, 3, 1, 2, 3}
	 *  + output: {5, 1, 3, 2, 3}
