	 * Towers of Hanoi: In the class problem of Towers of Hanoi, you have 
	 * 3 towers and N disks of different sizes which can slide onty any tower.
	 * The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from
	 * top to bottom (i.e, each disk sits on top of an even larger one). You
	 * have the following constraints:
	 * 	(1) Only one disk can be move at a time.
	 * 	(2) A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto another tower
	 * 	(3) A disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk
	 * Write a program to move the disks from the first tower to the last
	 * using stacks
	 *
